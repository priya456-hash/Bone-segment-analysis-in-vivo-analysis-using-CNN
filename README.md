#Abstract

The medical eld is advancing with novel technologies which have re-
sulted in a large amount of medical data demanding more manpower
to do medical imagery. Lately, Deep Learning, a part of Articial In-
telligence has expanded into multiple elds including the health indus-
try. In the current society where bone diseases are getting prevalent
over time, deep learning algorithms can help in quantifying sections
of bone which can reduce the time taken by medical professionals in
analyzing histological and pathological imagery. It is necessary to an-
alyze X ray images for bone defect shown in Figure 1 for early cure
by medical professionals.


A Convolutional Neural network is an important aspect of deep learn-
ing which can be considered for analysis as it gives high performance
and resolved end-to-end classication problems better than any other
machine learning algorithms Yu et al. (2020). In this thesis, a pre-
trained CNN algorithm has been used for classifying sections of bone
which include brous tissue, bone marrow, bone with osteocytes, bone
without osteocytes, and biomaterial. CNN model has been ne-tuned
to provide high prediction accuracy on the dataset received from the
Bioengineering Research team at NUI Galway. The bioengineering
team shows their ndings on thesis "strategies to enhance angiogen-
esis and bone formation" led by Maebh. Our thesis led to the de-
velopment of a model which would reduce the time taken by medical
professionals in analyzing this imagery and henceforth, led to early
detection of bone diseases and their treatment. Experimental Results
in this thesis depict higher accuracy and lower loss achieved on train-
ing, testing, and validation dataset provided for bone segment analy-
sis. The pretrained VGG16 model has outperformed in comparison to
ResNet50 and AlexNet that are widely used for medical image analy-
sis. Moreover, our ne tuned model is able to classify segment "bone
with osteocytes" accurately which determine bone quality. Higher the
density of bone of osteocytes within bone, higher is the quality of bone
which could be used for bone regeneration for the people dealing with
bone defects.
